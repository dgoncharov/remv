remv is an utility which finds files and directories that match a regular expression
and moves them according to the format, specified by the user.

The official homepage of remv is http://sourceforge.net/projects/remv.

Usage: remv regex format [path] [options]

v1.0
Starting from #path recursively renames all files and directories
which match the regular expression specified by #regex
according to the format specified by #format.
The boost::regex library is used for regex processing.
(See boost.org for details on supported regex syntaxes).
If path is not specified . is used.
To move all uppercase chars to lowercase chars use "(\w+)" "\L\\1"

Options:
  -h [ --help ]         this help message
  -v [ --version ]      print the version
  -r [ --recursive ]    rename directories recursively
  -p [ --pretend ]      only show the transformations

A regular expression and format have to be specified.
If path is not specified the current directory is used by default.
If no --recursive specified only the currect directory is searched.
If --pretend is specified remv show which files and directories would be moved,
but will not actually move them.
